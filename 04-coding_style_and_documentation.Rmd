# Coding style and documentation

## Coding style

From my experience, programmers are a weird bunch with a very individualist approach to shaping their code. Unrestrained, they can turn any programming project into a scorched-earth battlefield of formatting styles and coding conventions. To avoid this, an agreement should be made before starting the project (ideally for all future projects) on the following issues:

**Code formatting.** This is one of the most inflammatory topics in programming generally, and among R programmers particularly [^2]. First and foremost, there are no better and worse styles, but whichever formatting style has been chosen, it should be used consistently by the team.

For R, the most widespread is the formatting style proposed by Hadley Wickham and described in [The tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/). It's based on [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). There are tools available for reformatting ([formatR](https://yihui.name/formatr/), [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/)) and validating code ([lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr)) according to these rules.

**Code design.** TBD

**Code organization.** TBD

[^2]: To elaborate on the "`<-` vs `=`" dispute: there are virtually *no* differences between the two (ambiguity when using `=` as an assignment operator can be avoided by enclosing the expression in brackets), and none of them is "superior". Robert Gentleman -- one of the fathers of R -- in his book *R Programming for Bioinformatics* uses `=` for assignments. You should keep in mind, though, that most R programmers use `<-` and some package repositories may reject code using `=`.
