# Coding style and documentation

## Coding style

From my experience, programmers are a weird bunch with a very individualist approach to shaping their code. Unrestrained, they can turn any programming project into a scorched-earth battlefield of formatting styles and coding conventions. To avoid this, an agreement should be made before starting the project (ideally for all future projects) on the following issues:

**Code formatting.** This is one of the most inflammatory topics in programming generally, and among R programmers particularly [^2]. 

**Code design.** 

**Code organization.** 

[^2]: To elaborate on the "`<-` vs `=`" dispute: there are virtually *no* differences between the two (ambiguity when using `=` as an assignment operator can be avoided by enclosing the expression in brackets), and none of them is "superior". Robert Gentleman -- one of the fathers of R -- in his book *R Programming for Bioinformatics* uses `=` for assignments. You should keep in mind, though, that most R programmers use `<-` and some package repositories may reject code using `=`.
